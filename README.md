This is the HTML/CSS Project for The Odin Project's Web Development 101 Course.

The goal of the project is to copy the Google homepage, which I did, albeit not perfectly.

I learned how to find images, how to use the FireFox Developer Tool, and how some CSS layouts work, e.g. absolute positioning.

The project became more fun as a I put the finishing touches on the page.
